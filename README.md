The original resource from the first one of Node.js/express 4 projects [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwfE7fSVaZM)

In the video, the author use Mongoose, but I redo the project by using MongoDB and tweaking some error functions. 

Also, I modified the js file so the user does not put empty values in the input field.
